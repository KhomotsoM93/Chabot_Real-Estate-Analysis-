## Background & Overview 

The real estate industry relies on timely communication and seamless customer engagement. AI chatbots have revolutionized customer interactions by providing instant responses, answering property inquiries, scheduling viewings, and even qualifying leads. This project aims to evaluate the efficiency of AI-powered chatbots in handling customer inquiries, reducing response time, and increasing lead conversion

## Data Structure Overview 

The dataset consists of real estate chatbot interactions, covering various inquiry types, response times, lead qualifications, and booking conversions.

## Executive  Summary 

### Key Findings

•	Most Common Inquiries: Property Info (40%), Booking (25%), Financing (20%)
•	Average Response Time: 5.2 seconds
•	Lead Qualification Rate: 48% of inquiries convert into leads
•	Booking Success Rate: 55% of inquiries lead to a scheduled viewing
•	Slowest Response Time: 10 seconds (needs optimization)
•	Failed Conversions: Financing inquiries have the highest failure rate

### Business Implications

- Customers primarily seek property information and booking assistance, indicating the chatbot should focus on providing detailed property insights and seamless scheduling.
- The response time is within an acceptable range, but further optimization is needed for outliers (e.g., responses taking longer than 5 seconds).
- Lead conversion can be improved by analyzing why certain inquiries fail to qualify.
